#	NoSQL 



##	What is NoSQL?

-	NoSQL is a non-relational DMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoids joins, and is easy to scale
-	NoSQL database is used for distributed data stores and NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps
-	For example, companies like Twitter, Facebook, Google that collect terabytes of user data every single day
-	NoSQL database stands for "Not Only SQL" or "Not SQL

##	Why NoSQL?


-	NoSQL is used to deal with huge volumes of data	
-	The system response time becomes slow when we use RDBMS for massive volumes of data
-	The concept of NoSQL databases became popular with Internet giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc
-	To resolve this problem, we could "scale up" our systems by upgrading our existing hardware. This process is expensive.

-	The alternative for this issue is to distribute database load on multiple hosts whenever the load increases. This method is known as "scaling out."

-	NoSQL database is non-relational, so it scales out better than relational databases as they are designed with web applications in mind.

##	Features of NoSQL

-	Non-relational

	-	NoSQL databases never follow the relational model
	-	Never provide tables with flat fixed-column records
	-	Doesn't require object-relational mapping and data normalization
	-	No complex features like referential integrity joins, ACID

-	Schema-free
	-	NoSQL databases are either schema-free or have relaxed schemas
	-	Offers heterogeneous structures of data in the same domain

-	Simple API
	
	-	Offers easy to use interfaces for storage and querying data
	-	Text-based protocols mostly used with HTTP REST with JSON
	-	No standard based query language
	-	Web-enabled databases running as internet-facing services
	
-	Distributed

	-	Offers auto-scaling and fail-over capabilities
	-	Often ACID concept can be sacrificed for scalability and throughput
	-	Only providing eventual consistency
	-	Multiple NoSQL databases can be executed in a distributed fashion
	-	Shared Nothing Architecture. This enables less coordination and higher distribution.

##	Types of NoSQL Databases

-	Key Value Pair Based

	-	Data is stored in key/value pairs. It is designed in such a way to handle lots of data and heavy load.
	-	Key-value pair storage databases store data as a hash table where each key is unique, and the value can be a JSON, BLOB(Binary Large Objects), string, etc.	
	-	Redis, Dynamo, Riak are some examples of key-value store DataBases. They are all based on Amazon's Dynamo paper.


-	Column-based
	-	HBase, Cassandra, HBase, Hypertable are examples of column based database.


-	Graph-Based

	-	A graph type database stores entities as well the relations amongst those entities
	-	Neo4J, Infinite Graph, OrientDB, FlockDB are some popular graph-based databases.


-	Document-Oriented:
	
	-	Document-Oriented NoSQL DB stores and retrieves data as a key value pair but the value part is stored as a document. The document is stored in JSON or XML formats. The value is understood by the DB and can be queried.
	-	Amazon SimpleDB, CouchDB, MongoDB, Riak, Lotus Notes, MongoDB, are popular Document originated DBMS systems.




##	Query Mechanism tools for NoSQL

-	Retrieval mechanism is the REST-based retrieval of a value based on its key/ID with GET resource 


##	What is the CAP Theorem?

-	CAP theorem is also called brewer's theorem. It states that is impossible for a distributed data store to offer more than two out of three guarantees

	-	Consistency
	-	Availability
	-	Partition Tolerance


-	Consistency
	-	The data should remain consistent even after the execution of an operation
	-	This means once data is written, any future read request should contain that data.
	-	For example, after updating the order status, all the clients should be able to see the same data
	
-	Availability:

	-	The database should always be available and responsive. It should not have any downtime.

-	Partition Tolerance:

	-	Partition Tolerance means that the system should continue to function even if the communication among the servers is not stable. 
	-	For example, the servers can be partitioned into multiple groups which may not communicate with each other. 
	-	Here, if part of the database is unavailable, other parts are always unaffected.
	
	
##	Eventual Consistency

-	The term "eventual consistency" means to have copies of data on multiple machines to get high availability and scalability. Thus, changes made to any data item on one machine has to be propagated to other replicas.

-	Data replication may not be instantaneous as some copies will be updated immediately while others in due course of time. These copies may be mutually, but in due course of time, they become consistent. Hence, the name eventual consistency.

	-	BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency
	
		-	Basically, available means DB is available all the time as per CAP theorem
		-	Soft state means even without an input; the system state may change
		-	Eventual consistency means that the system will become consistent over time
		
##	Advantages of NoSQL

-	No Single Point of Failure
-	Easy Replication
-	Big Data Capability
-	It provides fast performance and horizontal scalability.
-	Object-oriented programming which is easy to use and flexible


##	Disadvantages of NoSQL

-	No standardization rules
-	RDBMS databases and tools are comparatively mature
-	Limited query capabilities
-	It does not offer any traditional database capabilities, like consistency when multiple transactions are performed simultaneously.
-	Doesn't work as well with relational data
-	When the volume of data increases it is difficult to maintain unique values as keys become difficult
