#	MongoDB Indexing  - createIndex(), dropindex() 


### createIndex()


				db.Employee.createIndex({EmployeeId : 1});
		
-	The createIndex method is used to create an index based on the "Employeeid" of the document.
-	The '1' parameter indicates that when the index is created with the "Employeeid" Field values, they should be sorted in ascending order
-	The documents will now be sorted as per the Employeeid and not the _id field.
	
	-	The id field is used to uniquely identify each document in the collection which is created automatically in the collection by MongoDB
	
				
				db.Employee.createIndex({Employeeid:1, EmployeeName:1])
				
-	The createIndex method now takes into account multiple Field values which will now cause the index to be created based on the "Employeeid" and "EmployeeName". 
-	The Employeeid:1 and EmployeeName:1 indicates that the index should be created on these 2 field values with the :1 indicating that it should be in ascending order.

##	How to Find Indexes: getindexes()

-	The getIndexes method is used to find all of the indexes in a collection.


##	How to Drop Indexes: dropindex()

				db.Employee.dropIndex(Employeeid:1)

-	The dropIndex method takes the required Field values which needs to be removed from the Index.


				db.Employee.dropIndex()

-	The dropIndexes method will drop all of the indexes except for the _id index.
