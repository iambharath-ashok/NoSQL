#	MongoDB 

-	MongoDB is a document oriented NoSQL database used for high volume of data storage


##	What is MongoDB?

-	MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage
-	It falls under the category of a NoSQL database


##	MongoDB Features

-	Each database contains collections which in turn contains set of documents
-	Each document can be different with varying number of fields
-	The size and content of each document can be different from each other
-	The document structure is more in line with classes and objects. But classes are not rows and columns but have a clear structure with key-value pairs.
-	With NoSQL databases the rows doesn't need to have a schema defined beforehand
-	Instead, the fields can be created on the fly.
-	The MongoDB environments are highly scalable


##	MongoDB Example

-	Document structure in mongo db

	{
		_id: 563479cc8a8a4246bd27d784,
		customerName : 'bharath',
		order : {
			orderId: 123,
			product: productA,
			quantity: 5
		}
	}

-	The _id field is added by MongoDB to uniquely identify the document in the collection
-	What we can note is that the Order Data (OrderID, Product, and Quantity ) which in RDBMS will normally be stored in a separate table, while in MongoDB it is actually stored as an embedded document in the collection itself. This is one of the key differences in how data is modeled in MongoDB


##	Key Components of MongoDB Architecture


-	_id:
	-	This is a field required in every MongoDB document. The _id field represents a unique value in the MongoDB document
	-	The _id field is like the document's primary key
	-	If you create a new document without an _id field, MongoDB will automatically create the field
	
-	Collection :
	-	This is a grouping of MongoDB documents
	-	A collection is the equivalent of a table in RDMS such as Oracle or MS SQL
	-	A collection exists within a single database. ollections don't enforce any sort of structure.
	
-	Database :
	-	This is a container for collections like in RDMS wherein it is a container for tables
	-	Each database gets its own set of files on the file system
	-	A MongoDB server can store multiple databases
	
-	Document :
	-	A record in a MongoDB collection is basically called a document
	-	The document, in turn, will consist of field name and values
	
-	Cursor :

	-	This is a pointer to the result set of a query
	-	Clients can iterate through a cursor to retrieve results
	
-	Field :
	-	A name-value pair in a document
	-	A document has zero or more fields. Fields are analogous to columns in relational databases
	

-	JSON :

	-	This is a human-readable, plain text format for expressing structured data
	-	plain text
